                <h1>SETTING ACHIEVABLE GOALS</h1>
                <p><i>Setting achievable goals is crucial when learning new skills; holding yourself accountable for completing them is something different altogether. That’s why I’ve begun to write the goals I set down - so there’s no ambiguity. Here, I’ve reflected on how well I’ve done and what could be done differently.</i></p>

                <p>-Set aside time to cool down at end of the day<br>-Drink less!!<br>-Win at ping pong</p>
                <p>Sometimes after a long day of working on my computer, I’ll come home, wind down for a little, remember what I’d been working on, get reinvigorated, and ramp up again later at night. After, I’ll get into bed and find my sleep uneasy, consumed by an active brain and tossing and turning. So tonight I want to dedicate the hour before I go to bed to reading. Not on the computer or on the phone. Like in a book, something completely unrelated to the program and current events. It helps me lower my heart rate, slow down my thoughts, and forget about the day. While I couldn’t get in the full hour, I did about half that and found it beneficial to my mindset the next day; tonight I’ll aim closer to that full hour.</p>
                <p>With access to a free (included) keg of beer, I’ve found myself compelled to take advantage nightly, increasing my habit considerably in the three weeks since we started. That means way more beer farts. So this week, I’m looking to cut my intake from 2-3 a night to just 0-1. I’m not going cold turkey, that’s crazy talk! I successfully skipped the keg and had one out of the six pack at home with dinner so I’m feeling good about this one. I’ve got a happy hour on Wednesday coming up and that’s where the focus will be.</p>
                <p>This last one has been tearing me the fuck up, no lie. Despite playing nearly every day, I haven’t gotten a single W yet on that table! I can keep pace and competition, but when I’ve managed advantage, I’ve crumpled under the self induced pressure. It’s entirely a head game at this point. A head game with myself. I’m dying for a win. I lost at lunch, but I’ve still got the afternoon, and literally every other day in the program… plus the six months I still have access after and if I decide to join a league or something. I’m getting that win. </p>

                    <p>-‘Set the stage’ more effectively<br>-Look at my phone less<br>-Investigate independent topics of research</p>
                    <p>I’ve noticed a few negatives in my workflow that I’ve targeted in today’s goals. The first two are related to distraction - rather than attacking a problem, I find myself out of focus, browsing the tabs I’ve got open, diving into an article or essay, talking to a neighbor, etc. etc.. Otherwise, I might be scrolling down on my phone, avoiding the wall I just hit rather than looking for a way over it and on towards the next task. The first one was easy to tackle: I started going off on my own (or else putting in headphones) to avoid chatty rabbit holes. I also closed the tabs on my browser irrelevant to the task at hand and found my avoidance in terminal and browser go way down. The phone is inherently more tricky, since it’s always on me. Do not disturb helps, but I can always unlock it and start opening apps willy nilly. So I downloaded Moment, an app that tracks the amount of time you spend on your phone and organizes the data so you can shock yourself into seeing your life stretch out before you and know, tangibly, that given the average amount of time spent on that sucker, you’ll have wasted 11 years glued to the screen by the time you die. Considering my phone makes me anxious or sad more than anything else, that thought is depressing. So at the very least now I am slightly self conscious that a clock is ticking while I am tapping and scrolling.</p>
                    <p>The last goal is something I want to push myself into more, and it’s about getting out of my comfort zone. While I can handle some of the drills without too much effort, there’s always something more I can do. For instance, in the second static webpage drill, I noticed the page we are modeling from has a fixed navbar and it also flips orientation when it reaches a certain screen size. And it went well! I know a little about mobile first development from independent study from before the program, so I decided to dive back into it and set up a media query for it just for fun. Outside of the program, there’s plenty of tech related topics I’d like to look into, just to activate my own curiosity and imagination a little more. And also impress my friends.</p>

                <p>-Write 3 pages daily<br>-Ask more questions</p>
                <p>Today I started strong with my three pages and actively thinking during class of questions to ask, even if they were to myself or answered before they were asked. Writing daily is a habit I’ve picked up and dropped any number of times through my life - it’s difficult to continue during a schedule change or move. When I do it the first thing in the morning, before I’ve woken up completely, it connects me to my subconscious, letting thoughts flow in non linear patterns, and, I hope, helps problem solving. I managed the three pages, but only just; the last one came slowly and the process took me a solid twenty minutes. I hope to get more fluid as the practice comes back to me. </p>
                <p>Asking questions, or even just thinking of questions to ask, are an important part of actively listening. They engage the listener in the talk and help anticipate where the session is going. While I did come up with things to ask, I’m not the most assertive in class and can often let others do the asking. Tomorrow, I’ll focus on speaking up and asserting what I need out of the break out.</p>
