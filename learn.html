                <h1>LEARNING TO LEARN</h1>
                <p><i>As my tool kit grows, understanding how I learned a new skill can give me insight on how to improve the learning process down the road. Below are some of the things I’ve done to learn the building blocks of a developer’s tool box.</i></p>

            <div class="post">
                <h1>PROCESS - Git and Github</h1>
                <p>11/30<br>As a part of the developer’s workflow and environment, you can’t get more crucial than Github. Being fluent with its commands and having a picture of how it works lets you create and collaborate on a whole world full of programming. Github’s community is stuffed with resources to help you learn, make your working environment homey, and progress your professional career. I had encountered Github in my independent studies, and even went so far as to create a repo or two, but I didn’t ingrain it into my developing routine so I barely appreciated its usefulness.</p>
                <h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
                <p>After tackling the Command Line and File Systems Management drills, I knew they were brutally rigid - one incorrect line and the whole thing would have to be redone. So I needed focus. To the solitary confinement/cubby/cell! I cleared all the tabs out on my browser and put my phone on do not disturb, until I could bang the drills out one by one.</p>
                <h3>Play</h3>
                <p>Once I secluded myself from the outside world, I realized I’d need to do some research on a few of the commands, and, more importantly, how they worked. Gaining a larger picture of how the pieces in play worked together moved a few blocks out of the way, and it let me go above and beyond what the tasks required to grow my own understanding of the tech. I was even able to describe the difference between ‘fetching’ and ‘pulling’ later that day to everyone’s surprise, not least of all my own. Even though I put myself in solitary, it took me seeking help to figure out I had been spelling ‘origin’ ‘orgin’ for about twenty minutes. And once I had submitted the drills, I made sure to cement my understanding by taking it to some others in the class that were still working on it. </p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Github has opened up an impossible amount of possibilities for me and my life in programming. With this basic fluency, I can access an enormous amount of resources that will help in my learning process and professional career. And it’s, like, totally free, man. While it was happening, it was hard to see the importance of continuously restarting from the beginning of the file tree and working my way out, but it’s given me an adequate amount of troubleshooting abilities in the terminal and I’ve memorized the commands by rote. Considering I use github in my daily life as a student (and will almost definitely continue in my future), learning this tech was crucial to understand before going further in my education</p>

                <h1>PROCESS - Flexbox and Grid</h1>
                <p>12/4<br>Initially, when I started learning programming languages late last year, I ran from flexbox. I found bootstrap through Codecademy and held onto it like a crutch. Setting out from my comfort zone and towards more personalized websites was something I was hella down for. It’s what I came here to do! Flexbox and Grid let you layout just about anything in a way less buggy way than floating everything all around ever could. In conjunction, the two tools can power any design under the sun. As someone that’s interested in design and maybe even front end development as a career, they’re absolutely essential to grasp.</p>
                <h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
                <p>The first step was attending some breakouts. I needed the most basic building blocks to start from, since I totally shied away from them to begin with. Being outside of your comfort zone with a group of individuals experiencing and experimenting with the same things you are helps growth by magnitudes. So collaboration and communication were key in learning how to navigate both flexbox and grid.</p>
                <h3>Play</h3>
                <p>There’s only one way to learn CSS correctly, and that’s to literally play around with it. After playing games like Flexbox Froggy and Grid Garden, I felt comfortable implementing the techniques on elements on my own and over the next three drills in building basic websites, I started to get the hang of and understand the technologies. Things that seemed abstract when I started became clearer the more experience I had actually doing it. I also realized how much more valuable working on your own files in an actual coding environment is than being led by the hand in a sandbox game or closed setting like Codecademy. Don’t get me wrong, Codecademy gave me syntax and a lot of confidence, but there’s nothing like hitting a brick wall and trying innumerable amounts of solutions until finally scaling it to teach you the real juice of a skill.</p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>By the time I had finished the three website drills, I can confidently build a skeleton of a webpage in no time at all. In my independent research, I found how bottomless and powerful a language CSS can be. Sites like CSS Zen Garden show the range of the possibilities and give me a place to get to with my growing skill set and palette. I’ve taken to task my interest in design with a free course over email, and it’s a great place to go when I feel burnt out in the program. Productive procrastination! Sass also opens possibilities: I thought of a far reaching project for when I’m out of Galvanize - a style sheet for my own personal site and blog. It would be an exercise in masochistic levels of obsession and also impressive to any potential employers, hopefully. </p>

                <h1>PROCESS - Javascript</h1>
                <p>12/7<br>This is what I’m here for. I knew within a couple of days of when I found Javascript that not only was this something I could build a career on, it was something that I could delve into for a lifetime, solve satisfying problems in, and most importantly, enjoy doing. Javascript is the de facto language of the web and knowing it lets you build anything you might want. When I first found Javascript, I also realized that I would need some serious help to get to the level I wanted to achieve. Repetition and dedication is how I learned my second language and I’ve found those principles helpful on my second. But asking others whose well of knowledge is much deeper than mine has been absolutely crucial in understanding new concepts and moving forward in my journey.</p>
                <h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
                <p>Focus, again, is the number one ingredient in getting through to a problem or learning a new concept. I also like walking myself through the problem and understanding what each line of code is doing (or not doing). Outside of that, working with others that are right there with you, a little ahead, or a little behind lets more ideas into the workflow. I can get fixated on one solution when it clearly isn’t working, so having outside input breaks down a lot of walls for me.</p>
                <h3>Play</h3>
                <p>Changing little things in simple code, seeing the difference in outcome, then trying to figure out why it happened is the ultimate way to see how the language works, piece by piece. Repl.it is my favorite environment to do these sorts of exercises. The internet is lousy with resources for Javascript, but the best for dedicated learning is Codewars. I played with Codewars prior to the program and it’s been keeping up with my level as I’ve progressed. </p>
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Javascript has already been a long, winding road; everyday I’m here, I can see farther into the distance, how much more there is to know. Ultimately, it’s exciting knowing how much more I have to learn. It can be exhausting. Just last week, I had a major breakthrough and felt ecstatic at how I was grasping new concepts. The next day, I felt dumber than a sack of rocks while staring at the next problem in my path. To use a tired cliche, it’s a rollercoaster of confidence and enthusiasm for Javascript. But I’m here for the ride.</p>
