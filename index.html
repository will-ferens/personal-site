            <img src="./imgs/prof.jpg" alt="Will Ferens">
            <p>Hello! You’re visiting a page by Will Ferens and this is a bit of copy about him: Will is a web developer, writer, and lover of the outdoors. With a focus in Javascript, Will has a tech tool kit suited for a dynamic range of projects. If there’s something he doesn’t know, give him some time and a bit of strong coffee; he’ll take it from there. Will prides himself on his strong communication skills, for-the-team mindset, critical thinking, and leadership experience. While he’s not building applications and designing sites, you can find him enjoying a book, getting lost in the woods, or skiing knee deep in fresh snow. </p>

            <p>Eventually, this site will be mobile, have some fun animation, and might even include some writing from yours truly. Until then, enjoy the posts about what it’s like to learn and grow at Galvanize!</p>
